SNVs and Indels form the class of "small" genetic mutations which is frequently
described as affecting anything from single base pairs up to around 10,000 base
pairs. By contrast, SVs and CNVs are typically considered large genetic
mutations that disrupt many genes and create gene fusions with novel cellular
functions. Typically, large chromosomal changes that favor cancer progression
develop in a tumor over time, altering the response to treatment, rate of growth
and capacity to spread within the body.
